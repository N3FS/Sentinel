### Info

Created by mcmonkey4eva on behalf of the Citizens and Denizen teams.

- **IMPORTANT:**
- NPC's won't do melee damage? In your config.yml file, toggle the setting that says "workaround damage" to true, and restart your server!
- NPC's won't do ranged damaged, or protection plugins causing problems? In your config.yml file, toggle the setting that says "enforce damage" to true, and restart your server!

### Usage

- First, get acquainted with Citizens in general for best luck using Sentinel.
- Second, download the plugin and put it into your server's `plugins` folder.
- Third, start the server to generate a config, then close the server and edit the config to your liking and finally restart the server.
- Now, to create your first Sentinel:
	- Select or create an NPC (`/npc sel` or `/npc create Bob`)
	- Run command: `/trait Sentinel`
	- Run command: `/npc equip`
	- Give the NPC items as needed, by right click the NPC with the wanted item.
	- Run command: `/sentinel addtarget MONSTERS`
	- Spawn a zombie via creative inventory eggs and watch it die!
	- Run command: `/sentinel help`
		- This will list all your options to edit the NPC's Sentinel settings.
			- Play with them freely, just be careful if you have other players around!
			- Do note, they won't attack you unless you run command: `/sentinel removeignore owner`.
- Examples:
	- To make your NPC attack sword wielders, use `/sentinel addtarget helditem:.*sword`
